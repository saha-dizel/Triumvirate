# Triumvirate
Triangular pixelization of image based on color segmentation

Heavily inspired by the one and only https://github.com/gregzaal/Useless-Tools

This is one of my silly projects. It can do several effects:

- Pixelization: this effect will literally pixelate the picture

- Color segmantation: this effect will give you contours of the picture in white. At times this can look quite disturbing)

- Trianlulation: this effect will find contours of the picture, then split it into dots and draw triangles on those dots. Then result will be put in green on the original picture.

- All at once: this effect is the most fun. Upload any picture, that then will be processed and split into triangles. After that all the triangles will be drawn with the single colour, so you can create triangular pictures.

Work with jpg and png.
